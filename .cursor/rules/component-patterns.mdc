# Component Development Patterns

## Reusable Components
- Create components that can be used across the application
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper prop validation
- Follow single responsibility principle

## Modal Components
- Use controlled visibility (isOpen prop)
- Implement proper focus management
- Handle escape key and backdrop clicks
- Provide clear close mechanisms

## Form Components
- Use controlled inputs with state management
- Implement proper validation
- Handle form submission with loading states
- Provide clear error feedback

## Data Fetching Components
- Use useEffect for data fetching
- Implement loading and error states
- Handle empty states gracefully
- Optimize re-renders with proper dependencies

## Event Handling
- Use descriptive event handler names
- Implement proper event propagation control
- Handle async operations in event handlers
- Provide user feedback for actions

## Styling Patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Maintain consistent spacing (p-4, m-2, etc.)
- Use responsive design patterns
- Follow the established color scheme (#0A4056 for header)

## Component Composition
- Break down complex components into smaller pieces
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper prop drilling patterns
- Consider using context for deeply nested props
