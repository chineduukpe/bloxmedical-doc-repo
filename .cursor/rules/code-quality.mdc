# Code Quality Standards

## Clean Code Principles
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful comments only when business logic is complex
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels)

## TypeScript Best Practices
- Always use explicit types for function parameters and return values
- Use interfaces for object shapes, types for unions/primitives
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)
- Use strict equality (`===`) over loose equality (`==`)

## Error Handling
- Always handle errors gracefully with try-catch blocks
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log errors for debugging but don't expose sensitive information
- Use proper HTTP status codes in API responses

## Performance
- Use React.memo() for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Implement proper caching strategies
